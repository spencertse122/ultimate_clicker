# Ultimate Clicker

Ultimate Clicker is a frantic 10‑second tapping challenge. Hit the start button to reset the timer and score, then smash the clicker as fast as you can before the buzzer. When the clock hits zero, your round locks in as the new top score if you managed to beat your previous best.

## How To Play

1. Launch the app and press **Start 10 Second Timer**.
2. Tap **Tap Clicker** as many times as possible while the timer counts down.
3. Try to beat your **Top Score** every round. When the timer expires, the clicker disables until you start a new run.

## Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/flutter_app_from_vs.git
cd flutter_app_from_vs
flutter pub get         # install dependencies
flutter run -d <device> # e.g. chrome, macos, ios, android
```

### Optional: Run Tests

```bash
flutter test
```
